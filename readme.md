The scripts and a sample notebook have been uploaded to this repository. To access the full project folder which contains the train and test datasets, trained models and scripts, use the unzipped folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17S5M7NTXJ3xAjW115NCAB7eu4ktlRziO?usp=sharing). Make sure you download the entire `Final_Year_Project` folder and pass the path as the argument of `Config_Handler.init()` (
In order to run the scripts and train a model, you need to call the init method of `Config_Handler` class by passing the appropriate path that points to the unzipped folder. Have a look at the notebook in the repo for an example)

All the test scripts are located in src/test_scripts
To install and import the libraries, install the packages at `requirements.txt` file.


A simple UI to interact with the model will soon be available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/Mohammadreza490/source_separation
