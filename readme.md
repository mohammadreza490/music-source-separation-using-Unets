This folder contains codes and a project report of my BSc Computing final year project. In this project, A Unet model was created to perform music source separation and separates a music into vocals and accompaniments. The implementation is based on [SPECTROGRAM-CHANNELS U-NET: A SOURCE SEPARATION MODEL
VIEWING EACH CHANNEL AS THE SPECTROGRAM OF EACH SOURCE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11520.pdf)

The scripts and a sample notebook have been uploaded to this repository. To access the full project folder which contains the train and test datasets, trained models and scripts, use the unzipped folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17S5M7NTXJ3xAjW115NCAB7eu4ktlRziO?usp=sharing). Make sure you download the entire `Final_Year_Project` folder and pass the path as the argument of `Config_Handler.init()` (
In order to run the scripts and train a model, you need to call the init method of `Config_Handler` class by passing the appropriate path that points to the unzipped folder. Have a look at the notebook in the repo for an example)
